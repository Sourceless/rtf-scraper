Currently a problem: only works when links are relative paths. Might fix but this project isn't exactly long term.

Problem 2: my rushed attempt at getting them to go into nice files/folders didn't work. Preserved in filename instead.

# To use

Go into the directory you want to scrape the site to and then `python <path-to-scraper.py>`
